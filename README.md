idk what to put here lol but remember MOOSHLOL304 on github made this ig? but please dont use this in an unethical way this is just to get the hosting ip  so please dont
use this for ddosing as this is the ip you use for it but anyways yea
so this is a simple socket connection python program i wrote which you can enter the ip of a minecraft server like play.hypixel.net and it will output its hosting ip which is 209.222.115.59
